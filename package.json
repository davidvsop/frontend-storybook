  "description": "+ Utilizing Storybook gives the design team the ability to create pages and play with existing components as they appear on the website, as opposed to starting from Figma or Photoshop each time they begin the design process. + This helps cut down on communication between teams after a mock-up has been created, since both teams can see exactly what components/pages are in production, and how they work in production. + Storybook can also serve as a handy brand guide.",
